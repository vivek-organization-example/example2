# --explanation--

The word `solid` means strong, reliable, or stable. For example:

- `The plan is solid.` - The plan is well-thought-out and reliable.

- `If your backup system is solid, you don't have to worry about losing data.` - This means the backup system is reliable and effective.

In Maria's context, she is saying the system is dependable and in good shape.
