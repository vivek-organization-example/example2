# --explanation--

The word `critical` means something very important or essential, and `critical data` refers to important information that the team relies on to work effectively. Losing it would cause delays or problems. For example:

- `The backup includes all critical data in case of a failure.` - The saved copy contains essential information to recover from a problem.

- `You must encrypt critical data to ensure it's secure.` - Protecting important information with encryption is necessary for security.
