# --explanation--

Mark mentions `incompatible drivers` and `outdated software` as causes for a software crash.

`Incompatible drivers` are drivers that do not work correctly with the hardware, while `outdated software` means the software has not been updated to its latest version. Both can cause crashes. For example:

- `The graphics card isn't working because of incompatible drivers.` - The wrong driver is causing the graphics card to malfunction.

- `Outdated software can lead to security vulnerabilities.` - Old programs might not be safe to use due to a lack of updates.
