# --explanation--

The word `right` at the end of a sentence is a question tag. It's used to confirm agreement or check if the listener understands. For example:

- `It's going to rain today, right?` - The speaker is asking for confirmation about the weather.

- `You finished the project, right?` - The speaker is checking if the listener completed the task.

In this dialogue, Bob is asking Maria to confirm or agree with his statement.
