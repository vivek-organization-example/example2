# --explanation--

`Fail` means something isn't working as it should. It refers to a problem that affects the normal operation. For example:

- `The server is failing because of high traffic.` - The server is crashing due to too many users at once.

- `The app failed during the beta testing phase.` - The application didn't work properly when tested by users.
