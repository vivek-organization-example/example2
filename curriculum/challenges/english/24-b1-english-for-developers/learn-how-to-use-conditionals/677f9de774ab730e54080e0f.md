## --blanks--

`not functioning`

### --feedback--

`won't load`

### --feedback--

This means `will not start or operate`. The first word is a contraction, and the second describes an action related to initiating something.

# --explanation--

The sentence uses a `First Conditional` to describe a possible situation in the present or future. For example:

`If you restart the system, the problem will go away.` - Restarting the system will likely resolve the issue.

In the dialogue, `If it's not functioning` refers to the condition, and `the operating system won't load` describes the result of that condition.
