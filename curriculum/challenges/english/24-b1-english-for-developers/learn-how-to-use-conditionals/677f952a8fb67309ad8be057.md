# --explanation--

Sarah indicates that while the power connection might be part of the problem, it isn't the only issue:

- `I did` confirms that Sarah has already checked the power connection, meaning she has ruled it out as the sole problem.

- `but` introduces a contrast, showing that while the power connection was checked, it isn't the only issue.

- `more than just` makes it clear there are other factors involved.
