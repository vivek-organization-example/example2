## --blanks--

`is corrupted`

### --feedback--

The first word is an auxiliary verb, and the second is the main verb in its past participle form.

# --explanation--

The `Present Simple` tense is often used to describe states, facts, or conditions that are generally true. This tense is used because the corruption of the BIOS is considered a stable or unchanging condition when the computer tries to boot up.

`Is corrupted` means damaged or changed in a way that causes it to stop working properly. For example:

`The file is corrupted and won't open.` - The file is damaged and cannot be accessed.
