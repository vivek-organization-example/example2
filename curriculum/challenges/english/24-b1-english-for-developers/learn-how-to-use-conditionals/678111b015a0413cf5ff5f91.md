# --explanation--

The sentence uses a `First Conditional` structure:

- The condition: `If we automate it` (what needs to happen),

- The result: `we don't have to worry about people forgetting` (the benefit of automating).

`Automate` means to use machines or systems to handle a task instead of doing it manually.

`Don't have to` means something is not required or necessary.
