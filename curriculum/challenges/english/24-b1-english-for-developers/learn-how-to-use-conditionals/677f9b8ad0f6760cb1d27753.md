The `hard drive` is a storage device in a computer that saves data like documents, software, and system files. It is essential for the computer to operate and store information permanently. For example:

- `I saved the project files on my hard drive.` - You stored the project files on your computer's storage device.

- `The hard drive crashed, and we lost some data.` - The storage device failed, causing the team to lose information.
