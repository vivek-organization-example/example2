# --explanation--

Listen carefully to Mark's question: `Have you updated the drivers recently?` Identify the key words in the question:

- `updated` tells us that Mark is asking about something that was done in the past (recently).

- `drivers` is the most important part. Mark is specifically asking about drivers, not software or the system.
