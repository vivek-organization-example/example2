# --explanation--

The question `Did you check that?` is asking if someone verified or confirmed something. In this context, Mark wants to know whether Sarah checked the connection of the power cable to ensure it's secure. Other examples:

- `Did you check that the windows are closed?` means asking if someone ensured the windows are securely shut.

- `Did you check that the light is off?` means asking if someone confirmed the light is turned off.
