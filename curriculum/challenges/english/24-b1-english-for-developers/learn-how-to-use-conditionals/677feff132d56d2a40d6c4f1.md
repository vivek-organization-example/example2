# --explanation--

The correct response, `No. Not really`, indicates that there isn't a specific issue to address. It's a polite and casual way to reassure someone that everything is fine. For example:

- Question: `Is something wrong with the system?`

- Answer: `No. Not really.`

This means there might be minor concerns, but nothing serious.
