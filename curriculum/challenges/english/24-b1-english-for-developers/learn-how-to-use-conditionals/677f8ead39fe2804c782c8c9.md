# --explanation--

Sarah is asking if Mark has noticed a problem with some computers not `booting properly`.

`Have you noticed` shows Sarah is checking Mark's awareness of the problem, not asking him to fix it or perform any action.

`Booting` means starting a computer by loading its operating system. For example:

- `Have you noticed the network is running slowly?` - This asks if someone has observed an issue.

- `The laptop isn't booting properly; we need to check the operating system.` - This highlights a common problem where a computer fails to start correctly.
