# --explanation--

The word `regularly` is an adverb used to describe an action done at consistent or repeated intervals. It is often associated with habits or routines. For example:

- `I exercise regularly.` - This means exercising consistently, perhaps every day or a few times a week.

- `She checks her email regularly.` - This means she checks her email often, such as daily.

Doing something regularly ensures good habits and prevents issues, as in backing up data to avoid loss.
