# --explanation--

This sentence uses the `Zero Conditional`, which describes general truths or situations that are always true when the condition is met. In this case:

- `If we automate the process` (condition),

- `there's less chance of human error` (result).

The word `if` introduces the condition, and `there's` expresses the result of that condition.
